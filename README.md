# Roxana Vatamanu 

Hi there! If you're reading this that means my attemp at making a Bio in Markdown was somewhat successful. I'm Roxana, I'm 23, I'm Romanian but I live in London and I just finished my Aerospace Engineering with Management degree. 

Hobbies:

Something maybe a bit unusual, but I enjoy watching football and last year I volunteered at the UEFA EURO 2021 championship

I like listening to music, I listen to pretty much anything, but below is just an example to see if the link is working (I would add an emoji, but I can't get it to work haha)
